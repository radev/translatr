# Translatr

## Description

[![Koding Hackathon](/images/badge.png?raw=true "Koding Hackathon")](https://koding.com/Hackathon)

Quick translation tool for people. It will allow parallel translation by multiple people in realtime. 
You are going to see changes made by other people, and they will see yours.
To make collaboration easier you can see what sentence other people selected.

## APIs used

We used PubNub API to communicate between users during translation.

We used next open-source frameworks, libraries and tools:
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - to serve backend
* [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.org/package/bluebird) - great promise library to avoid callback hell with async code
* [RethinkDB](http://www.rethinkdb.com/) - to save translations on the server
* [Ampersand.js](http://ampersandjs.com/) - for models
* [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - for web application components
* [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) - styling
* [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) with [generator-browserify](https://www.npmjs.org/package/generator-browserify)
* [Gulp](http://gulp.js) - nice build pipeline
* [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) - magic asset packaging
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - we have other things to do than getting basic html code
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) and lots of [NPM](https://npmjs.org) packages

## Our food stack

We used next beverages during coding
* Green tea (a lot of it)
